--- Welcome to the HowTo search engine ---

HowTo is a semantic search engine designed to index tutorial content with the innovation of streamlining the process of discovering this information better than a traditional search engine. HowTo must be opened in a web browser through the index.html file in order to be used. There exist only two potential queries that give web results as of Version 0.0.1.1. “mirror in blender” and “kettle chips” will provide a small selection of search results. Every result has a proper description and title. The search bar on the results tabs contain the same functionality that the home page does. The settings button is nonfunctional as there is currently no method of configuration for this software. There is a home button that takes the user back to HowTo’s landing page.

The development goals in descending order of priority are to make the site look more visually appealing, implement a proper web crawler, optimize the search script so that each page doesn't require it's own copy of the script, and implement a user reporting feature.

In order to perform these development goals, the following requirements need to be met by the developer.

Write web crawler
Generate an index of the content provided by the web crawler
Figure out how to cull undesirable results from the index
Learn how to create and securely store user login information
Discover a way to aggregate user submitted reports

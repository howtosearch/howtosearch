--- Welcome to the HowTo search engine ---

HowTo is a semantic search engine designed to index tutorial content with the innovation of streamlining the process of discovering this information better than a traditional search engine. HowTo previously required to be ran locally on the machine, but now is hosted via github. Every result has a proper description and title and is indexed in data.txt. The search bar on the results tabs contain the same functionality that the home page does. The settings button is nonfunctional as there is currently no method of configuration for this webpage. There is a home button that takes the user back to HowToâ€™s landing page, however.

The development goals in descending order of priority are to make the site look more visually appealing, integrate it's web crawler better, and implement a user reporting feature.

In order to perform these development goals, the following requirements need to be met by the developer.
